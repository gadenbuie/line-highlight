## Example 01

Here we have highlighted line number 2 and 4 to 5 and have also added line numbers at the left side using `numberLines` class.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| class-source: "highlight numberLines"
#| highlight-line-numbers: "2,4-5"

# library call
library(dplyr)

# code
iris |> 
  summarize(mean(Sepal.Length))
```

## More Example (without line Number)

Here we have just highlighted the second line.

Add `group_by()`:

```{r}
#| class-source: "highlight"
#| highlight-line-numbers: "2"

iris |> 
  group_by(Species) |> 
  summarize(mean(Sepal.Length))
```
